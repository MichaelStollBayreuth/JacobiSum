# JacobiSum

Results on Jacobi Sums

This repository contains formalizations in Lean+Mathlib of some results on Jacobi Sums.
We mostly follow the book of Ireland and Rosen.

We use this as a staging area for Mathlib.

The code is based on work done by Alexander Spahl for his BSc thesis in Bayreuth.
